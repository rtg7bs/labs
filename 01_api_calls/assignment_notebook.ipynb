The plastic wheel assemblies on these wheelbarrows, manufactured by O. Ames, a predecessor company of Ames True Temper, can break when the tires are being inflated. This can result in plastic pieces exploding from the rims of the wheels, possibly hitting nearby consumers and causing lacerations and other injuries. Ames True Temper has learned of additional serious incidents involving the recalled wheelbarrows since the original recall announcement. A total of 21 incidents have occurred from 1996 to the present, including injuries involving hand, arm and facial fractures and cuts. In a few cases, more serious and permanent injuries have been reported. To prevent further injuries, consumers should not inflate the tires on these wheelbarrows. Ames True Temper is offering a free replacement steel wheel assembly for each wheelbarrow and is offering consumers a free gardening tool gift as an incentive to have this repair performed. The wheel assemblies on these wheelbarrows have a black plastic rim and have an approximately 14-inch diameter wheel. They have red, green or orange tubs or trays made of steel or plastic and were sold under the brand names \"Easy Roller,\" \"Homeowner,\" \"Mustang,\" or \"Thoroughbred.\" The brand name was printed on the label attached to the tray at the time of purchase. Wheelbarrows with metal wheel assemblies are not part of this recall. No \"True Temper\" or \"Jackson\" wheelbarrow is part of this recall. Hardware stores and home centers nationwide sold the recalled wheelbarrows from January 1993 through December 2000 for between $20 and $30. In addition to the free replacement wheel assembly and free gardening tool incentive, the company is conducting the recall campaign with new measures to reach home gardeners who are the primary users of these recalled wheelbarrows. These new measures include placing ads in gardening publications, providing recall information to editors and webmasters of specialty gardening magazines and Web sites, and providing new point-of-sale posters to retailers.

The carts can tip over and injure or kill children and adults when the cart and the television fall. Sauder Woodworking has received 13 reports of these carts tipping over. The firm received a report of the death of a 19-month-old girl in North Wales, Pa., who suffered a fractured skull when the cart and television fell on her. There were four reports of additional injuries involving children and adults. One report involved a skull fracture to a child who recovered and three reports involved bumps and bruises. These TV/VCR carts were sold in a kit to be assembled by consumers. They are identical in design and construction, but not color. One model is a light-colored oak finish and the other model is a dark- colored cherry finish. The TV/VCR carts are about 29.5-inches wide, 18- inches deep and 27-inches high. The carts are equipped with a top shelf intended to support up to a 27-inch television, a middle shelf intended to hold a VCR and a lower storage area intended to hold VCR tapes and equipment. The products were provided with shelves for holding VHS tapes that were to be installed on the inside of the two hinged doors enclosing the lower storage area. The recalled carts have four removable casters attached to each bottom corner of the cart. The TV/VCR carts included in the recall are models 2655 and 2755. The model number is not on the cart, but it is on the instruction booklet that came with the cart. Department, discount and home electronic stores nationwide sold these TV/VCR carts from January 1993 through December 1999 for about $100.

Recall Alert U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 August 20, 2002 Alert #02-555 CPSC, Polaris Industries Inc. Announce Recall of RANGER Off-Road Utility Vehicles and Professional Series Utility Task Vehicles (\"UTVs\") PRODUCT: RANGERs and UTVs - Polaris Industries Inc., of Minneapolis, Minn., is voluntarily recalling about 7,600 RANGER Off-Road Utility Vehicles and Professional Series Utility Task Vehicles (\"UTVs\"). Polaris dealers sold these vehicles worldwide from April 2001 through July 2002 for between $6,999 (2x4 model) to $9,949 (6x6 model) depending on the particular model. The RANGERs and UTVs were manufactured in the USA. PROBLEM: The problem with the RANGER vehicles and UTVs involves the swing arm, which is part of the rear suspension. During operation of the vehicle the pivot bolts of the swing arm can loosen and fall out. If this happens, the swing arm can become partially disconnected from the frame. This can result in the vehicle losing power because the drivetrain connection to the wheels is no longer maintained. If this were to occur, the loss of power and resulting swing arm disorientation could cause the operator to lose control of the vehicle, resulting in injury to the operator. INCIDENTS/INJURIES: Polaris Industries Inc. has received twenty-three reports possibly related to the loose pivot bolt issue. One passenger was injured when she bumped her head on the cab frame. WHAT TO DO: Consumers should stop using these vehicles immediately and contact their local Polaris dealer to schedule an appointment for a free repair.

The Lifesaver models could alarm late or not alarm at all, and the Nighthawk models could alarm late. These alarms are used to detect carbon monoxide (CO), a colorless, odorless gas, leaking from fuel burning appliances. When they don\\'t work, consumers can be unknowingly exposed to hazardous levels of CO, and suffer injury or death. Kidde Safety and CPSC are not aware of any injuries involving these products. This recall is being conducted to prevent the possibility of injury. The Nighthawk models included in this recall are all models manufactured between November 8, 1998, and March 9, 1999. The manufacturing date is on the back of the unit as year, month, day. \"NIGHTHAWK\" and \"Carbon Monoxide Alarm\" are written on the front of the unit. If \"Carbon Monoxide Detector\" is written on the front, the unit is operating properly and is not part of the recall.

Hardware and mass merchandise stores nationwide sold these alarms beginning in 1998 for about $20 to $50. Consumers should not return the alarms to stores. The initial symptoms of CO poisoning are similar to flu, and include headache, fatigue, shortness of breath, nausea and dizziness. Exposure to high levels of CO can cause death.

NHTSA, CPSC Announce Recall of Evenflo On My Way Infant Car Seats/Carriers The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) announced the recall of about 800,000 Evenflo On My Way infant car seats/carriers because of a defect that can cause serious injuries to children while the seats are being used as infant carriers. Parents should continue using these rear-facing infant car seats, but should not use the carrying handle until new parts are installed to fix the problem, said NHTSA Administrator Ricardo Martinez, M.D. Safety is our highest transportation priority. A child safety seat that is installed and used correctly is the most effective safety device available for young children in automobiles. The recall involves On My Way infant car seat/carrier model numbers 207 and 492 manufactured from Dec. 15, 1995, to July 27, 1997. The model 492 is the On My Way Travel System, which includes a stroller. Model 207 is the car seat/carrier without the stroller. The manufacture date and model number are located on the bottom of the seat. Juvenile product, mass merchandise and major discount stores nationwide sold the car seats beginning in January 1996 for about $60 to $70, and the car seat with stroller for $150 to $175. The red push button assembly on each side of the seat that is used to latch and adjust the carrying handle can unexpectedly release and cause the seat to flip forward. There have been 176 reports in which the carrying handle latch unexpectedly released, resulting in 89 injuries to children, including bruises, concussions and skull fractures. The injuries occurred to both restrained and unrestrained children. This is a serious problem that puts infants at risk, said CPSC Chairman Ann Brown. The latches on these car seat carriers can release without warning. Parents who have this car seat should call for the free repair kit immediately. The recall results from a cooperative investigation conducted by NHTSA and the CPSC. Evenflo will provide a repair kit, free of charge, with redesigned latch buttons that will make the handle latch much stronger. The repair can be done in the home with a Phillips head screwdriver. Until the seats are repaired, NHTSA and the CPSC advise owners not to carry a seat by its handle, but to use the hand holds at the head and foot of the seat. Owners of these seats should call Evenflo at (800) 233-5921 to give their name and address so that they can receive the repair kit, or visit Evenflo's web site at www.evenflo.com to find out more information on this recall. Consumers with questions about this recall campaign may call NHTSA s toll-free Auto Safety Hotline at 1-800-424-9393. The number to call in the Washington, D.C., area is 202-366-0123.

The combination infant seat and carrier features a removable leg rest, removable feeding tray and a metal frame permitting use as either a rocker, stationary seat or carrier. When used as a carrier, consumers may carry the product by holding it under its detachable leg rest. By carrying it in this manner, the leg rest may come off and allow the product to fall off the carrier. Pines of America has received two reports of leg rests becoming detached while being used to carry the infant and carrier, allegedly allowing the infant being carried to fall out. The products were sold by numerous retail stores nationwide under the brand name of \"Tenderkare,\" model 412 and by Sears, Roebuck and Co. under the brand name of \"Winnie-the-Pooh Rocker-Carrier,\" model 36511, between 1975 and 1980 for approximately $20.00. No other infant seat/carriers are involved in this refund program. Earlier efforts by the firm to reach owners of affected products have resulted in few returns of the detachable leg rests. Consumers owning affected models should discontinue use of the detachable leg rest as a handle and should return the leg rest (with their name and address) in exchange for a $5.00 refund to Pines of America, 5120 Investment Drive, P.O.

The carriers were manufactured between March 1979 and February 1981 and were being repaired because of a potential infant finger entrapment in the hinge mechanism on the moveable stand which supports the carrier when it is placed on a surface. The potential for entrapment occurs if the carrier\\'s stand bar is opened while the child is in the carrier on the adult\\'s back and the child\\'s fingers are out of view. The Commission is aware of at least 23 incidents of finger entrapment resulting in 9 injuries. Injuries have included pinching, lacerations, and partial finger tip severance. Only carriers manufactured between March 1979 and February 1981 are involved. Carriers manufactured before or after these dates are not subject to the recall since they contain differently designed hinge mechanisms. The carrier was sold under the \"Gerry\" brand name by independent and chain retailers nationwide, as well as in U.S. Army and Air Force Exchanges. Retailers included K mart, Best Products, Woolworth, Woolco, Toys \"R\" Us and Montgomery Ward. The carrier was also sold nationwide under the label \"Pak-A-Poose\" by Sears, Roebuck and Co. The carriers sold at a price range of approximately $18-$30. To identify the product, consumers should locate the plastic brace at the bottom of the carrier. The date code of two, three or four digits is imprinted on the lower right inside portion of the brace (when facing the carrier straps). The first number is the last digit of the year the product was made. The following number or numbers on the top and bottom lines indicate what day of the year the item was manufactured (see attached drawing). Products covered by the program fall between 9/64 (the sixty-fourth day of 1979) and l/60 (the sixtieth day of 1981). All carriers with date codes beginning with the digit 0 are affected since they were made in 1980. Consumers who have these carriers should discard them. Repair parts are no longer available. Consumers who have questions about this recall may contact Evenflo\\'s Parent Link Consumer Resource Center at (800) 233-5921.

(June 22) -- Collier-Keyworth Co., Gardner, Mass., in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), today announced a voluntary repair program for about 5,600 of its models 6805, 6806, 7805 and 7806 car seat/stroller conversion kits. The kits are used to convert a baby car seat into a stroller by snapping the seat onto a frame. CPSC staffers believe that a design defect in the metal seat supports of the stroller frame could cause the supports to spread apart, allowing the seat to disengage and throwing the infant forward. CPSC has learned of 13 incidents where this happened. At least five of the children received lacerations and other facial injuries. The stroller kits in question, which were distributed nationwide, retail for about $28 and were manufactured before March 14,1977. Some, but not all, the units may have the model number on the back leg of the frame. More important, if your stroller conversion kit does not have two hinged metal braces riveted at right angles to the top of the stroller frame seat support and reinforcing the seat from directly beneath, call or write Collier-Keyworth Co., P.O.

(Apr. 11) -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) today announced the recall of three electric toy road racing sets and certain power pack transformers sold separately. These items fail to comply with Federal regulations for electrically-operated toys and are, therefore, banned from sale. The recalled items, all distributed by Strombecker Corporation, Chicago, Illinois, are \"ROAD AMERICA RACE SET - Model #9900,\" \"MONZA ROAD RACE SET - Model #9902,\" \"CAN AM ROAD RACE SET - Model #9924\" and replacement power pack toy transformer Model #9703-G. Road Race Set Model numbers 9900, 9902 and 9924 contain power pack toy transformers which fail to comply with certain requirements of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA) and pose a potential electrical shock hazard to the user. No injuries associated with these toys have been reported to the Commission. The power pack toy transformers are colored blue-gold or blue-yellow with a black base, the casing is labeled in part, \"Power Pack Toy Transformer\" near two rivets on either side of the on-off switch and hole in the base. The toys were distributed nationwide to hobby and toy stores. Electric toys are subject to regulation under the FHSA which requires banned toys to be repurchased or replaced by the manufacturer, distributor and dealer.

(Oct. 15) -- Hamill Manufacturing Company, Washington, Michigan, and the Huffman Manufacturing Company, Dayton, Ohio, in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, today warned consumers that 25,000 bicycle child carriers may separate from the bicycle if not carefully installed. The carriers were sold nationally under the trade name \"Tote Along\" during the summer of 1976. Persons who have these carriers should carefully inspect both the latching mechanism which locks the detachable child seat to the carrier and the metal clamp which attaches the front of the carrier to the bicycle frame. Before placing a child in the carrier, check to see that the seat and clamp are secure. The warning was issued after the companies reported to CPSC 10 accidents which involved either a separation of the seat from the carrier or of the carrier from the bicycle. Separation of the seat from the carrier appears to have been caused by a failure to push the seat onto the carrier far enough to secure the locking mechanism. Separation of the carrier from the bicycle may have been caused by consumer misalignment of the metal clamp components and/or extreme over-tightening of the bolt passing through the clamp. In the interest of child safety, the companies are recalling the \"Tote Along\" carrier and are offering a refund to consumers who send them the seat clamp. For instructions on how to receive a refund, consumers should write The Hamill Manufacturing Company, Consumer Relations Department, P.O.

WASHINGTON, D.C. (May 19, 1975) -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission today provisionally accepted a consent order signed by Keller Industries, Inc. requiring the company to recall certain carpets and rugs which fail to meet Federal flammability standards. (DOC F l-70). Keller Industries also trades under the name American Carpet Mills. Non-complying goods were previously pulled from inventory and the distribution chain. The carpets and rugs involved in the recall are in style \"Caravan\" and were sold nationwide from January 27, 1972 to May 12, 1972. The style \"Caravan\" carpet is composed of 100 percent polyester pile, is shaggy in nature and comes with a jute back. It comes in various colors and is sold in 12 foot wide rolls which can be cut to varying lengths. A Commission spokesman said that any remaining carpeting and rugs involved in the recall are probably in the homes of consumers. Consumers who believe they may have such carpets or rugs in their home should contact Keller Industries, Inc., 18000 State Road 9, Miami, Florida 33162 (305-651-7100). The consent order requires the company to notify all purchasers and either process the carpet and rugs to bring them into compliance with the standard, or destroy them. By signing the consent agreement, the company also agrees not to violate Federal flammability standards in the future. This action is voluntary and does not constitute an admission of guilt by the company. A violation of the consent order could result in civil penalties up to $5,000 per violation. The complaint and consent order will remain on the public record for comment through July 18, 1975. Interested persons may submit comments to the Office of the Secretary, U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, 1750 K Street, N.W., Washington, D. C. 20207.

(March 5) -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission today informed consumers that three styles of nylon pile carpeting made by Apollo Carpets, Inc., Route 2, Dalton, Georgia, and sold to consumers prior to April 1972 failed to meet mandatory flammability requirements. The three styles, sold by retail stores primarily in the south central and south eastern United States, were \"Uranius,\" \"Moonwalk,\" and \"Mars.\" The carpets were of various colors and came in 12 foot wide rolls that could be cut to different lengths. The Commission provisionally accepted a consent order signed by the company and by Billy R. Cox, a principal officer of the company. The company has agreed to inform known purchasers and to institute a second recall of the non-complying carpet. The firm stopped sales of these carpets in April 1972 when notified by the Federal Trade Commission that they failed flammability requirements. In August 1972, Apollo initiated a recall and 4,500 square yards out of a total of 53,000 square yards sold were returned. Consumers who bought this carpeting should return it to the store where it was purchased or to the manufacturer. A consent agreement is a legal document in which the company involved usually agrees to stop manufacturing or selling non-complying goods, notify known purchasers and initiate a recall. The action on the part of the company is voluntary, and the company does not admit guilt in agreeing to the terms. The company also agrees not to violate flammability standards in the future. A violation of this consent agreement could result in a civil penalty of up to $5,000 per violation. The complaint and consent order will remain on the public record through May 5, 1975, during which time any interested person may submit comments to the Office of the Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission, 1750 K Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20207. After considering any comments, the Commission may finally accept the agreement or withdraw its provisional acceptance.

These opportunities present many advantages: The data are larger, have more variety, and there are vastly many more cases. Building a third-party app that includes analytics could easily consume an entire semester and open a variety of applications in predictive analytics, natural language processing, and generative AI (e.g. predict which reviews are fake or real for Amazon for a product group like ``women's watches', and then make recommendations for different price points). While an exciting possibility, this can also raise a lot of problems: Some API's cost money or are rate-limited depending on a subscription, and others impose significant constraints on how the data can be used. In some cases, a more useful approach might be explicit web scraping using a package like BeautifulSoup or Selenium. For example, Craigslist has no API, but can easily and productively be scraped using BeautifulSoup.\n",

If you have had enough, I recommend https://www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/electricity, since there is a friendly query builder that you can use to learn.**"
